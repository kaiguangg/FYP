# FYP
#Final Year Project

The project is to propose new passwords for the users based on the “training”
provided. Essentially, the idea is to allow the software to propose a
combination of passwords based on what the users like to choose their own
passwords. As an example, if the user likes to use multiple alphabets of his
children names, then the software will provide proposals to secure those
passwords without sacrificing the users’ preference.
